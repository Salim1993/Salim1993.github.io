        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello, I'm Mohamed Salim Ben Khaled. I live in Edmonton, Canada. I'm a recent computer engineer graduate from the University of Alberta.<br> My hobbies are Weight Lifting, Basketball, Video Games, and Programming.<br>
          <br>One of the group projects that I have done in the past are a trading app for android where users can track trading card collection and also offer to trade cards. Another project was to build an app for Google's prototype Tango device that would take advantage of its enhanced spatial awareness. The augmented reality app places virtual spehere on a surface in the room that you tapped. The spehere would then go to your position as long as you were not looking at the sphere. I've also done a capstone project using the Altera DE2-115 Development board. Using the microonctroller, we tried to download a schedule from the internet that would then display that picture to a monitor.<br>
          <br> Currently, I'm working on this website, a separate video game log website, and making a simple game in Unity. You can check out my current work in the other tabs, or you can go the links below. </p>

        <h3>2D Brawler Game</h3>

          After going through the Unity tutorials, I decided to make my own game. Its a very basic platformer/action game. The object is to try and kill as many skeletons without getting hit. I've added platforms to allow the player more easily escape from the enemies.
          Below are the sprites that I have created for the game. You can check out the game in Github.

          Creating the assets for the game took a longer period of time than estimated, especially since I don't have any experience in artwork. The hardest part is trying to create the animations for the sprites. This is why I chose 32x32 size for the sprites to decrease the difficulty in creating them. <br><br>
          Future work for the brawler game is to improve the UI for the game. I will be adding a kill counter as well as a health bar for the player. In addition I will be adding on screen controls for a mobile version of the game.

        <h3>Game-Log Site</h3>
        <p>The purpose of the gamelog site is to track all the games that are in your collection. They will track different stats, such as which ones haven't been played and how long it will take. Other features may include tags and genres, and as well as different platforms. <br><br> I will update this page as it is a work in progress.</p>
